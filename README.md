## Node.JS Restaurant Template

This is a template for Node.js to help you get started writing a page for a restaurant.

## Who is it for?

Someone who knows javascript, got a job creating a site for a restaurant and doesn't want to spend a lot of time creating something from scratch because restaurants don't pay that much anyway.

## What's included?

A decent js slider (will be improved), a live twitter feed with search and stream options (will be improved), and a mailing list signup form connected to a MongoDB with mongoose (will be improved).

## Does it work?  Seriously, I looked at your code, its kind of ugly...

Yes it works!  I am not the greatest Dev but I will continue to make it better. I could use some help... and a job... with better Devs who will buy me a new computer and teach me the secrets of life through programming.  I live in LA :)
